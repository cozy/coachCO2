It will also help you to **awareness of the challenges** of mobility, to question your travel habits, and perhaps to find more sustainable alternatives.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What about the confidentiality of my private life?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs always with your Cozy: **you are by default the only one** with the right to **access your data**. And you can of course also **share them** with whomever you like, for as long as you like.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Can I advance ecomobility by sharing my anomymised data?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYes, as well as helping you to become more aware of your own mobility issues, the aim of the CoachCO2 application is to enable the emergence of new ecomobility offers thanks to studies based on anonymised and previously aggregated data such as distances travelled by means and objectives of transport. Some French **local authorities** are **already working** on this!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**And tomorrow ?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis memory of your trips is stored and secured in your personal cloud in a **standard format that can be reused and exported** as you wish.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe CoachCO2 application itself is regularly enhanced with **new features**. Today it focuses on mobility, but tomorrow other sources of CO2 could extend its scope, such as the energy consumption of your home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTomorrow, new applications will be able to offer you **other uses** thanks to the storage of this precious travel data. For example, you could build your own mapped albums of your travels or favourite activities, and share them with friends and family without having to use social networks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Acknowledgements and conditions of use**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis application is currently being developed and maintained by Cozy Cloud as a common asset. Launched in 2021 thanks to the agglomeration of **la Rochelle** and its Agremob programme, it was then supported by the department of **Alpes-Maritimes**. You can use it for free if you self-host your Cozy, or buy it from a third party. It is also available as part of the Premium packages hosted by Cozy Cloud (with a 1-month free trial in the discovery package).",
