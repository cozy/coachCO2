The application, itself under development, is today focused on mobility, tomorrow other sources of CO2 may extend its scope.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Agremob](https://agremob.com/) makes this application **a common good** that can be used beyond the borders of the La Rochelle agglomeration. If your Cozy's host does not offer it in its own store, contact them!",
